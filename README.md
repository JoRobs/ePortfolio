# System Requirements
The app uses Node 10+, Firebase, React and Redux as it's main dependancies, these must be installed on the machine before the app can be run.



# Installation Guide
## Deployment
As indicated in the [deployment architecture diagram](Documentation/DeploymentArchitecture.png) the application is authomatically deployed through Travis CI to a firebase project used for the development of the [demo](#demo), 

In order to deploy the project to a custom firebase project, a new firebase project must be set up with the app added in the firebase console. 

Several files within the app will need to be updated with the new project's information, namely:
* Front-End/everest/src/Firebase.js
* .firebaserc



## Local Testing
Installing dependancies requires npm to be installed on the local machine. 

Running ``` npm install``` in the root directory will install all dependancies for the backend and front end application for local testing.

Running ``` npm start``` in the root directory will install all dependancies and start a local emulator for testing purposes.
